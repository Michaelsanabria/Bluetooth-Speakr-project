Open Source Bluetooth Speaker

The Open Source Bluetooth Speaker project aims to create a fully customizable, modular, and energy-efficient wireless speaker system that connects seamlessly with other speakers through a mesh network.
This allows users to synchronize multiple speakers and stream audio from any Bluetooth-enabled device with minimal latency.

ðŸŒŸ Core Purpose

This projectâ€™s mission is to democratize audio engineering by providing an open platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation.
Whether youâ€™re a hobbyist, student, or hardware developer, this system offers a foundation to explore embedded audio design, wireless communication, and low-power optimization techniques.

ðŸ§  Main Technologies
	â€¢	Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) â€“ for wireless audio streaming and device connectivity
	â€¢	Mesh Networking Protocols â€“ to connect multiple speakers and share audio data
	â€¢	Flux.AI / KiCad â€“ for PCB design and circuit schematics
	â€¢	C / C++ â€“ for embedded firmware development
	â€¢	Python / Node.js â€“ for control interfaces and configuration tools
	â€¢	USB-C Power System â€“ with integrated low-power management and battery monitoring
